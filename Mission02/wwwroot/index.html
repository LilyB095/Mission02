        <p>
            For IS 413, I'm looking forward to understanding how to build a web app better. I was in a "just-survive" mode last
            semester with python and didn't start to grasp the big picture until INTEX. Now that I have a basic understanding of what
            building a web app is like start to finish, I'm excited to dig in and gain a better understanding. I'm also looking forward to learning how
            to protect code from attacks and make things more secure. Also, in a few years I'm hoping to launch a side business and I'll need
            the skills to build a decently robust and secure web app for that business.

        <b>TOP 3 JOBS of CURRENT INTEREST:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Data Analyst</b>
                <ul>
                    I think this is my top one. In my job, I get to work closely with management and get to see how they are trying to
                    implement new BI and more robust dashboards so they can make better decisions. Figuring out the data needed for that and the presentation of the
                    data so it tells an important story is really interesting to me
                </ul>

            <li>
                <b>Data Scientist</b>
                <ul>Not entirely sure where the distinct lines between Data Analyst/Scientist/Engineer are. But working with the data has been my favorite part of the Core so far. :D</ul>

            <li>
                <b>Data Engineer</b>
                <ul>Clearly I like the data! :D I like investigating and figuring out if it's clean, how to clean it up, constructing models, developing ways to better organize/store/use data. I get to see a bit of that at my job as well.</ul>
